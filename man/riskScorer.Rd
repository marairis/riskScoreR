\usage{
riskScorer(formula, data, y.name, feature.names, importance, weight,
  beta = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{[\code{\link{formula}}]\cr
An object of class \code{\link{formula}} (or one that can be
coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the model to
be fitted.}

\item{data}{[\code{\link{data.frame}}]\cr
A data frame (or object coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}})
to a data frame) containing the variables in the model.}

\item{y.name}{[\code{string}]\cr
A string giving the response variable name.}

\item{feature.names}{[\code{\link{character}}]\cr
A character vector giving the feature names.}

\item{importance}{[\code{numeric}]\cr
A vector of feature weights to be used in the fitting process.
Should be a named numeric vector.}

\item{weight}{[\code{logical}]\cr
A logical indicating weather weights should be applied
(\code{TRUE}) or used to identify alleles with flipped risk
allele (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{beta}{[\code{logical} or \code{function} or \code{number}]\cr
Depends on \code{weight}: \code{TRUE}, if weights are beta
coefficients; a \code{function} for transformation to beta
coefficients, if \code{weight} is \code{TRUE}; a \code{number}
giving a threshold as flip criteria, if \code{weight} is
\code{FALSE}. See 'Details'.}

\item{...}{Other parameter passed from and to other methods.}
}
\value{
\code{riskScorer} returns an object of class "\code{riskScorer}". An
object of class "\code{riskScorer}" is a list containing the following
components:
\describe{
 \item{\code{risk_model}}{An object of class \code{\link{data.table}}
                         specifying the risk model. Contains a column
                         \code{variable} with the name of the variant, a
                         column \code{weight} specifying its weight and a
                         column \code{flip} indicating if the risk alleles of
                         this variant have to be flipped.}
 \item{\code{beta}}{Depends on \code{weight}: \code{TRUE}, if weights are beta
                    coefficients; a \code{function} for transformation to
                    beta coefficients, if \code{weight} is \code{TRUE}; a
                    \code{number} giving a threshold as flip criteria, if
                    \code{weight} is \code{FALSE}.}
 \item{\code{weight}}{A logical indicating if weighting of risk alleles has
                      to be done.}
 \item{\code{formula}}{An object of class \code{\link{formula}}: a symbolic
                       description of the model to be fitted.}

\description{
\code{riskScorer} is used to fit a risk score models, specified
by giving a symbolic description of the linear predictor and weights from a,
for example GWAS, analysis.
}
\details{
Generally, importance values/feature weights are assumed to be beta
coefficients from a GWAS analysis. In this case, if \code{weight} is
\code{TRUE}, the number of risk alleles are multiplied with it's beta
coefficients to get a risk score. If no beta coefficients are available, a
function to transform the given weights to beta coefficient equivalents is
needed to be specified by \code{beta} (might be \code{\link{identity}}). If
\code{weight} is \code{FALSE} no weighting of risk alleles is performed. In
this case a threshold is needed to find flipped risk alleles by the given
weights. If beta coefficients are given (default) this threshold is set to 0.
It would be 1 if the weights are odds ratios. The parameter \code{beta} can
be set to any finite number.
