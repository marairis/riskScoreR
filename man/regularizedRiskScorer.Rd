\title{Fitting regularized Risk Score Models based on importance of SNPs}
\usage{
regularizedRiskScorer(a, balance, logarithmical, data, importance, weight,
  formula, beta, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{[\code{integer}]\cr
Number of SNPs used for inital penalty step, e.g. size of genotyping chip.}

\item{balance}{[\code{double}]\cr
Weight of penalty.}

\item{data}{[\code{\link{data.frame}}]\cr
A data frame (or object coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}})
to a data frame) containing the variables in the model.}

\item{importance}{[\code{numeric}]\cr
A vector of feature weights to be used in the fitting process.
Should be a named numeric vector.}

\item{weight}{[\code{logical}]\cr
A logical indicating weather weights should be applied
(\code{TRUE}) or used to identify alleles with flipped risk
allele (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{beta}{[\code{logical} or \code{function} or \code{number}]\cr
Depends on \code{weight}: \code{TRUE}, if weights are beta
coefficients; a \code{function} for transformation to beta
coefficients, if \code{weight} is \code{TRUE}; a \code{number}
giving a threshold as flip criteria, if \code{weight} is
\code{FALSE}. See 'Details'.}

\item{...}{Other parameter passed from and to other methods.}

\item{[\code{logarithmical}]\cr}{A logical indicating weather penalty step size should be equal (\code{FALSE}) or logarithmic (\code{TRUE}).
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{y.name}{[\code{string}]\cr
A string giving the response variable name.}

\item{feature.names}{[\code{\link{character}}]\cr
A character vector giving the feature names.}
}
\value{
\code{regularizedRiskScorer} returns an object of class "\code{riskScorer}". For more information see 
\code{\link{riskScorer}}.

\description{
\code{regularizedRiskScorer} is used to fit a regularized risk score models based on 
importance of SNPs, the number of SNPs used in the final model is calculated by an optimization
problem based on the models deviance less the current penalty for the number of used SNPs in the model.
}
\details{
Pentalty function can have equal or logarithmic step sizes. Set \code{a} as size of genotyping chip and use 
equal step size to determine the best amount of identical genotyping chips. Set \code{a} as a an inital step size an use 
logarithmic step size to regularize amount of SNPs (preferred all on one chip).
